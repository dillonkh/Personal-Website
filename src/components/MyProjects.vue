          This is it! You are currently looking at my personal website,
          congrats!
          <br />
          After my internship at SimpleNexus, I decided it was time to create a
          new website. This website is written in Vue.js and hosted on AWS S3 as
          a static website. Currently this website has no backend. My next step
          is to add some aspect of the website that would require a backend and
          emplement it with AWS Lambdas.
