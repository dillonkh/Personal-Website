      I started in January 2020 working part time for SimpleNexus. When school
      got out in May I transitioned to full time <br />
      This was my first coding experience working on a team, and I really
      enjoyed this aspect of it! My team was super cool and fun to be around.
      <br />
      This was also my first time working with Vue, Rails, and Graphql. I feel
      like I picked them up fairly quickly.

      I will always be grateful to Hughes for my first full time coding job and
      my first internship. <br />
      For this internship I got to my a small web app from scratch by myself
      (with the guidance of a great mentor and manager) <br />
      I chose to make this app using Flask Web Framework for the backend and
      Jquery for the front end.
